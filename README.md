## Unsupervised Deep Learning for Massive MIMO Hybrid Beamforming



In this repository you can find the simulation source code for paper title "Unsupervised Deep Learning for Massive MIMO Hybrid Beamforming". <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00038>

The channel model we used is a realistic ray-tracing channel model introduced in "â€œDeepMIMO: A Generic Deep Learning Dataset for Millimeter Wave and Massive MIMO Applications". <https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06435>


Repository is consist of:

**1.DATASET.md:** all parameters related to system model such as number of users, number of antennas, etc.

**2.Codebook_ij:** design codebook using algorithm proposed in the paper.

**3..py files:** simulation source codes

**DataBase_dataSet64x8x4_130dB_0129201820.npy:** core dataset for "limited area" scenario consist of CSI, RSSI, near optimal HSHO solutions. You can find it here:
